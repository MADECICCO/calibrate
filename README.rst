Calibration
===========

This is a simple tool that constructs a calibration curve using known x
and y values from standards, and backout the x value for an unknown
based on its measured y signal.

**Features**

-  Given x and y, creates calibration curve and finds linear portion and
   limits of linearity
-  Given y of an unknown, interpolates to find x
-  Computes interpolation error
