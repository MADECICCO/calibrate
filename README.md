Calibration 
-----------

This is a simple tool that constructs a calibration curve using known x and y
values from standards, and backout the x value for an unknown based on its
measured y signal.

**Features**

 * Given x and y, produces calibration curve and find dynamic range, limits of
   detection, quantification, and linearity
 * Given y for an unknown analyte, interpolates to find x for the analyte
 * Computes interpolation error
